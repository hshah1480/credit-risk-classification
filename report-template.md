## Overview of the Analysis


### purpose of the analysis.
Building a model that can accurately identify the creditworthiness of borrowers is crucial for P2P lending services. Such a model allows lenders to evaluate the risk associated with lending to a particular borrower, set appropriate interest rates, and make well-informed decisions about loan approvals. By leveraging historical borrower data and various financial indicators, lenders can assess the probability of default and make more reliable lending decisions.

### Stages of the machine learning process - as part of this analysis.
The machine learning model design process began with ingesting the labels into a model to split the data into training and testing sets. To determine the loan lending creditworthiness of an individual I used a logistic regression.

## Summary

Overall, the accuracy seems to be good enough to start exploring this kind of algorithms in a bank, however, I would prefer to start running a pilot with new data to assess model's reliability.
It's important to note that the effectiveness of the creditworthiness model heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the data collected. Therefore, it's crucial to have a comprehensive and reliable dataset to achieve accurate predictions.
